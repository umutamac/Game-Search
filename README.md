# UT Austin Coding Bootcamp - Full Stack Flex
# Project 1 - Game-Search-Engine

This is the first project of Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp by UT Austin. The collaborators on this project are Justin Torres (JuTo-Hub), Julian Rivera Jr (julianriverajr) and Umut Alptekin (umutamac).

The project is aimed at using Cheapshark's API to look at deals on digital games, and the API from https://prost.herokuapp.com/api/v1/beer/rand to suggest beers to go with game. The word user types to find deals are also stored using local storage and displayed for easy re-searching capability.

Our MVP has following criteria:
    - Use at least 2 different server-side API's
    - Use css framework other than Bootstrap
    - No alerts, prompts, or confirm windows
    - Implement client-side storage to store persistent data
    - Have a mobile-first UI
    
## Technologies Used

We made use of:
* APIs
* JavaScript 
* HTML
* styled with CSS
